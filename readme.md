# Silo File Format Specification v0.2

## 1. Purpose

A single UTF-8 plaintext file that represents a complete directory tree. Optimized for hand-writing and inspection.

## 2. Terminology

Key words MUST, SHOULD, MAY are per RFC 2119/8174.

## 3. Overview

A Silo file is a sequence of file sections. Each section starts with a file declaration line, followed by the file‚Äôs content lines. A fixed delimiter string identifies declaration lines. Blank lines outside sections are ignored.

## 4. Delimiter
- The delimiter MUST be a non-empty sequence of one or more Unicode characters that are not ASCII space (0x20), horizontal tab (0x09), line feed (0x0A), or carriage return (0x0D). Emoji and symbols are allowed (e.g., üåæ, ‚ùñ‚ùñ‚ùñ, ::, ===, ***).
- The delimiter is auto-detected from the first non-blank line, which MUST be a valid file declaration.
- All declarations in the file MUST use the exact same delimiter string. Matching is byte-exact in UTF-8.
- Writers MUST choose a delimiter such that no content line in the file begins with <DELIM><SP>. If a collision would occur, choose a different delimiter.

## 5. File declaration

Syntax:

```
<DELIM><SP><PATH><EOL>
```

Rules:
- <SP> is one ASCII space (0x20).
- <PATH> is a POSIX-style relative path using /.
- Paths MUST NOT be absolute, contain .., or contain NUL.
- Duplicate <PATH>s MUST be rejected.

## 6. Content
- All lines after a declaration up to the next declaration belong to that file.
- Content is included verbatim.
- Each file‚Äôs content MUST end with a newline. Readers MUST behave as if a trailing \n is present. Writers SHOULD include it.
- Readers MUST accept \n and \r\n; delivered content uses \n.

7. Collisions
- A line starting with <DELIM><SP> is always interpreted as a file declaration.
- Writers MUST choose a delimiter such that no content line begins with <DELIM><SP>.
- If a collision would occur, writers MUST choose a different delimiter.

8. Ignored lines
- Blank or whitespace-only lines outside any section are ignored.
- Blank lines inside a section are preserved.

9. Directories
- Directories are implicit. Implementations MUST create intermediate directories as needed for each <PATH>.

10. Media type and extension
- Suggested media type: application/vnd.silo.tree
- Suggested extension: .silo

11. Security considerations
- Reject absolute paths, .., and drive letters.
- Impose limits (file count, path length, file size).
- Write atomically with safe permissions.

12. Errors

Implementations MUST error on:
- Inconsistent delimiter string.
- Duplicate <PATH>.
- Disallowed <PATH> (absolute, .., empty, or .).

13. ABNF (informative)

ABNF cannot enforce ‚Äúsame delimiter string‚Äù globally and is limited for Unicode classes; prose above is normative.

silo            = *blank-line *(section *blank-line)
section         = file-decl *content-line
file-decl       = delim SP path-chars EOL
delim           = 1*delim-char  ; any non-whitespace Unicode scalar value
; delim-char is any Unicode scalar value except SPACE, TAB, CR, LF
; (expressed in prose; UTF-8 byte sequences omitted for brevity)

path-chars      = 1*path-char
path-char       = %x21-7E except %x20  ; visible ASCII except space

content-line    = *VCHAR EOL
blank-line      = *WSP EOL
SP              = %x20
EOL             = %x0A / (%x0D %x0A)
VCHAR           = %x21-7E
WSP             = %x20 / %x09

14. Reference parsing algorithm (normative)

normalize EOL to "\n"; read UTF-8
skip leading blank/whitespace-only lines
read first non-blank line L
  let i = index of first ASCII space (0x20) in L
  require i > 0
  DELIM = L[0:i]       ; must contain no SPACE/TAB/CR/LF
  PATH  = L[i+1:]      ; must be non-empty
current = new file(PATH)
for each subsequent line:
  if line starts with DELIM + " ":
     finalize current; start new file(PATH = text after space)
  else:
     append line to current file content verbatim
on close of a section, ensure content ends with "\n"
validate paths and duplicates

15. Writer guidelines
- Prefer a short delimiter like > or üåæ. If any content would start with <DELIM><SP>, switch to another sequence (e.g., ===, ***, ->, ‚ùñ‚ùñ).
- End the container file with \n.

16. Example

Using üåæ to demonstrate a non-ASCII delimiter:

``` silo
üåæ src/util.py
a = 1

üåæ hi.py
from src.util import a
print(a)

üåæ config/settings.json
{ "debug": true }
```

Yields three files:
- src/util.py with content: `a = 1\n`
- hi.py with content: `from src.util import a\nprint(a)\n`
- config/settings.json with content: `{ "debug": true }`

17. Conformance

A "Silo reader" MUST implement Sections 4‚Äì12. A "Silo writer" MUST implement Sections 4‚Äì8 and SHOULD follow Section 15.
